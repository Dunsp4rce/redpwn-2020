# Question

It's not just a string, it's a rope!

**Files**:
- [ropes]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ropes/ropes)

# Solution

On opening the executable file with `cat`, we can see the flag split into two parts:
- `First part is: flag{r0pes_ar3_` 
- `Second part is: just_l0ng_str1ngs}`

# Flag
```
flag{r0pes_ar3_just_l0ng_str1ngs}
```
