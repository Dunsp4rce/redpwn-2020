Encoding something multiple times makes it exponentially more secure!

**Files**
- [cipher.txt]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/sanity-check/cipher.txt)
- [generate.js]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/sanity-check/generate.js)

# Solution

From `generate.js` it is seen that the flag is encoded with base64 **25** times. Decoding with base64 25 times on the cipher text gives back the original flag.

**Program**
- [solution.py]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/sanity-check/solution.py)

# Flag
```
flag{l00ks_l1ke_a_l0t_of_64s}
```
