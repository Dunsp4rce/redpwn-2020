# Challenge

This bash script evaluates to echo dont just run it, dummy # flag{...} where the flag is in the comments.

The comment won't be visible if you just execute the script. How can you mess with bash to get the value right before it executes?

Enjoy the intro misc chal.

## Files
* [cmd.sh]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/uglybash/cmd.sh)

# Solution

* Run ` bash -x cmd.sh `
* The characters of the flag are in the lines ` +++ printf %s <flag-char> `
* Put together all the characters to obtain the flag<br/>
` flag{us3_zsh,_dummy} `
